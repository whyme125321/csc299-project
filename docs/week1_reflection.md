# Week 1 — Exploration & Brainstorming

##  Activities Completed
- Explored **Notion** to understand online PKMS features.  
- Explored **Obsidian** to understand offline markdown-based PKMS.  
- Discussed project ideas with an LLM to generate a timeline and plan.

##  Observations from Notion
- Easy to organize pages and link content with `[[ ]]`.
- Tagging and formatting are intuitive.
- Great UI but requires internet access.

##  Observations from Obsidian
- Works locally with Markdown files.
- Graph view clearly shows note relationships.
- Fewer rich-text options than Notion.

##  Ideas for My System
- Local storage using **JSON** (like Obsidian’s plain files).
- Support tags & backlinks.
- Terminal interface to add/search notes quickly.
- Simple task manager with due dates + priorities.

##  Next Step
Begin **Prototype #1** — a minimal PKMS that can add, list, and search notes stored in JSON.
