# LLM Conversation — Feature & Idea Brainstorming

### Question:
What makes a good personal knowledge management system?

### Answer:
A good PKMS allows users to:
- Capture notes easily.
- Link related concepts together.
- Tag and categorize information for flexible searching.
- Store data locally or in the cloud for persistence.
- Search quickly by keyword, title, or tag.
- View relationships between notes (like Obsidian’s graph view).

### Question:
How do Notion and Obsidian organize notes differently?

### Answer:
- **Notion** uses online databases, templates, and page hierarchies stored in the cloud.  
- **Obsidian** uses local Markdown files stored on your computer and connects them through `[[links]]`.  
For this project, we can combine both approaches:  
store information locally (like Obsidian) while using structured data (like Notion).

### Question:
What tags or features could I add to make my system unique?

### Answer:
- Tagging system using `#tags` for organization.  
- Ability to link notes with references (`[[note-name]]`).  
- “Favorite” or “starred” notes.  
- Date created / last edited timestamps.  
- Export or backup feature to text or JSON.  
- Search across titles and contents at once.

### Question:
How could I design a simple AI agent to prioritize my tasks?

### Answer:
Start small with a **rule-based system**:
- Tasks closer to their due date get higher priority.
- High-importance tags (like `#urgent`) are ranked higher.
Later, an AI agent can:
- Analyze deadlines and workloads to reorder tasks.
- Summarize key goals from notes.
- Recommend what to focus on each day based on context.

### Question:
What would make this PKMS stand out compared to existing ones?

### Answer:
- It runs entirely in the **terminal** for simplicity and portability.  
- Stores data in **JSON**, so users can easily inspect or edit it.  
- Integrates **AI summarization and task analysis** later on.  
- Lightweight, minimal, and doesn’t rely on a web connection.
