# Study Plan — CSC299 Final Project

##  Goal
To review and practice the key technical and conceptual skills needed for developing my PKMS and task management system.

---

##  Core Python Topics
- File handling (`open`, `read`, `write`, JSON)
- Working with data structures (lists, dicts, sets)
- Command-line input and loops
- Organizing code into modules and classes
- Exception handling (`try/except`)
- Unit testing with `pytest`

---

## Data Persistence
- Understanding **JSON** format
- Reading/writing JSON files for persistent state
- (Optional later) Intro to **SQLite**

---

## Software Design Concepts
- Separation of concerns (storage vs logic vs interface)
- Designing classes (`Note`, `Task`, `Storage`, `ChatInterface`)
- Planning modular functions
- Git version control (branching, committing, pushing)

---

## PKMS & Task Management Ideas
- How tools like Notion/Obsidian link notes
- Tagging, searching, and organizing content
- Managing tasks with priorities and due dates
- Simple data schemas (notes.json, tasks.json)

---

## AI Integration (for later weeks)
- How AI agents summarize or prioritize information
- Using LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Designing “helper” functions to analyze stored notes/tasks

---

## Next Step
Start **Prototype #1**:  
Implement the core PKMS system with basic add/list/search functionality using JSON storage.
