# tasks3

## Overview
This is the third milestone of my CSC-299 project.  
It converts my task manager into a Python package managed with **uv** and adds automated testing with **pytest**.

## Features
- Add, list, search, and delete tasks
- Tasks stored in a JSON file
- Command-line interface
- Two automated tests using pytest (`test_save_and_load.py` and `test_search_tasks.py`)

## How to Run
Run the program interactively:
```bash
uv run tasks3
