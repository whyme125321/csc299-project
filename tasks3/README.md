This version builds upon **tasks2** by introducing a **Python package structure**, **pytest tests**, and **uv** for environment management.  
It begins integrating automated testing and prepares for more complex functionality in later stages.

## Features
- Converted project into a Python package (`src/` and `tests/` folders)  
- Added `pytest` testing framework  
- Verified setup using `uv run pytest`  
- Ready for future AI and PKMS integration

```bash
uv run tasks3
