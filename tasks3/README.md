# Tasks3 – Pytest and UV Integration

## Overview
This version builds upon **tasks2** by introducing a **Python package structure**, **pytest tests**, and **uv** for environment management.  
It integrates automated testing and prepares for more advanced PKMS and AI agent functionality in later stages.

## Features
- Converted project into a Python package (`src/` and `tests/` folders)  
- Added `pytest` framework for automated testing  
- Verified setup using `uv run pytest`  
- Maintains all task management features from previous versions  

## How to Run
```bash
cd tasks3
uv run tasks3
